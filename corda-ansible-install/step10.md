We are almost there. We just need to make sure that Corda service is up and running correctly.

## Task

Please solve the existing Corda startup issues.

Here are few helpful commands:

- To start Corda manually, use: `cd /opt/corda && java -jar corda.jar`.
- To start Corda service, run: `systemctl start corda.service`
- To check Corda options, run: `java -jar corda.jar --help`.
