It seems we have some missing variable while running our playbook. We need to fix it.

## Task

Please define `corda_password_keystore` variable and set to `password` and re-run the playbook.

You may define the variable at runtime, or in a more permanent manner.

## Expected outcome

You should see the red error about missing Python library after running the playbook. If so, proceed to the next step.
