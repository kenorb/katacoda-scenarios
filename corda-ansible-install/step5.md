It seems we have some missing variable while running our playbook. We need to fix it.

## Task

Please define `corda_password_keystore` variable and set to `password` and re-run the playbook.

## Documentation

- <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_variables.html>

## Expected outcome

You should see the red error about missing Python library after running the playbook. If so, proceed to the next step.
