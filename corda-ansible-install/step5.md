It seems we have some missing variable while running our playbook. We need to fix it.

## Task

Please specify any non-empty value for `corda_password_keystore` variable and re-run the playbook.

Documentation can be found at: <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_variables.html>

Proceed to the next step, if you see the red error about missing Python library after running the playbook.
