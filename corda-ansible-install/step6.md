Now we need to solve the final dependencies.

## Task

1. Please solve any missing dependencies (such as Python libraries) by using Apt or Pip and re-run the playbook.
2. In case of _HTTP Error 501_, please correct the Maven repository URL to use HTTPS.

## Expected outcome

Proceed to the next step, if the playbook has been executed without any errors.
