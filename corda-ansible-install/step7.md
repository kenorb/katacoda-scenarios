We have now installed Corda. Now we need to download the _network-root-truststore_ certificate.

## Task

Please download the certificate file from the following URL:

- <http://devnet-doorman.cordaconnect.io/certificates/network-root-truststore.jks>

and place it under `/root/files`{{copy}} folder (create a new folder if required).
