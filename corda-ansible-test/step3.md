Since now we've cloned Ansible role, we need the actual playbook to install Corda.

## Task

Your task now is to create an Ansible playbook by the following steps:

1. Create a new `corda-ansible.yml`{{open}} file in the current folder.
2. Specify `localhost` as your host.
3. Specify `./corda-ansible` folder as your role.
